		<h1>Welcome</h1>
		<p class="text">The Tim Hortons National Museum (THNM) welcomes you.
We were given a mission.  Tim Hortons chose us.  Figuratively.  We could not avoid its fertile roussettes au miel sowing our streets.
The THNM is a playful space, where the visitors can observe the weird and wonderful merchandise we gathered.  Also, our visitors are encouraged to manipulate the objects on display.
The THNM is also a space dedicated to research, reasoning, and collective creation on a plurality of themes.  Notably on cultural identity, the occupation of unceded land, and workplace conditions.  All these issues are discussed through the lens of the famous coffee and donut company.</p>
